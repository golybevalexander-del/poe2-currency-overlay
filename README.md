# POE2 Currency Overlay

**Direct Barter fork:** this checkout adds a separate historical Direct Barter tab.
See [Direct Barter usage and Windows testing](docs/DIRECT-BARTER.md). It uses an
isolated `POE2 Direct Barter Fork` profile; upstream updates, remote feed switchover,
feedback and sample uploads are disabled. No installer for this fork has been
published. The upstream download links below do **not** contain this feature.
Original POE2 VibeTools attribution and GPL-3.0-or-later licensing are retained.

### Fork maintenance instructions

Repo-local agent **`upstream-release-maintainer`** reconciles newer upstream
releases while preserving Direct Barter. Its core skills are
**`adapt-direct-barter-ui`** (integration and regression map) and
**`create-fork-pr`** (reviewed publication to this fork only).

Select the agent in a supporting Copilot host and ask, for example:
"Compare the latest upstream release with this fork, propose a scoped
reconciliation branch, and preserve Direct Barter using adapt-direct-barter-ui.
Do not commit or publish." For later publication, explicitly authorize:
"Use create-fork-pr to commit the reviewed changes, push this feature branch,
and open a PR in golybevalexander-del/poe2-currency-overlay only."

The separate **`prepare-upstream-pr`** skill is opt-in: ask
"Use prepare-upstream-pr to assess an upstream contribution; do not publish."
Preparation and upstream draft publication need explicit scope/authorization.
It keeps one draft per contribution, not one after every fork merge, and
separates reusable changes from fork-only identity/update settings.

Definitions live in [the agent profile](.github/agents/upstream-release-maintainer.agent.md),
[UI adaptation skill](.github/skills/adapt-direct-barter-ui/SKILL.md), and
[fork PR skill](.github/skills/create-fork-pr/SKILL.md), plus the opt-in
[upstream contribution skill](.github/skills/prepare-upstream-pr/SKILL.md).
They do not run on a
schedule. Discovery depends on the host and checked-out branch; if absent,
reload/start a session on the feature branch or ask Copilot to read those files.
Availability on the default branch requires landing the relevant files there;
new local edits are not published until committed and pushed. No publication
is authorized merely by adding or selecting these instructions. Host-level
discovery and opt-in controls have not been verified in this session.

A hotkey overlay for **Path of Exile 2**: live currency exchange rates and arbitrage, an item price checker, and a Desecrate (Omen of Light) EV calculator. Press a hotkey, it appears over the game; press it again and it's gone.

Windows, built with Electron. It reads public data only — no game memory hooks, no automation, nothing that touches the game client.

## What it does

### Currency (F6)

- Live exchange rates from GGG's official Currency Exchange data, with the live trade-site order book on top for the pairs on screen.
- **Buckets** — a currency you want to buy, priced in every currency you'd pay with. A green **BEST** badge marks the cheapest way to pay; the other rows show how much more they cost.
- **Arbitrage routes** — a green **arb %** flags a profitable 3-trade loop from that row. Hover for the route step by step, pin it, copy it to chat.
- **7-day sparklines** with hoverable per-day history; type your own rate to override any pair.

### Price Check (Ctrl+F, or Ctrl+Alt+F for a quick check)

- Hover an item in game, press the hotkey, and it's parsed, filtered, and priced against live trade listings.
- Prices the item by its stats, not its exact mod text: fungible added-damage rolls match across elements, resistances fold into a pseudo total, weapons price on total DPS, and catalyst quality and Runic Ward are read correctly.
- Item level, quality and augmentable sockets are header range filters, pre-filled from your item.
- A **suggested floor** anchored on the cheapest genuine comparable (for weapons, scaled by how your DPS compares), so an outlier listing doesn't set your price.
- Hover any result to compare it to your item line by line, with quality, defence, resistance and socket totals beside yours.

### Desecrate — Omen of Light EV

- From a price-checked item with a desecrated mod, click **redesecrate?** in its corner — or paste any item onto the Desecrate tab.
- Pick the mods you'd keep and the worst tier you'd accept; each is weighted by its real spawn chance.
- It prices your item as it stands and with a hit, autofills consumable costs from live rates, and compares the routes (Preserved / Ancient / Altered) to a per-route EV and a plain verdict.

## Install

**Most people:** download the installer from the [website](https://poe2-vibetools.github.io/poe2-currency-overlay/) or the [releases page](https://github.com/POE2-VibeTools/poe2-currency-overlay/releases). Windows only. The build is unsigned, so if SmartScreen appears, choose **More info → Run anyway**.

**From source:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/POE2-VibeTools/poe2-currency-overlay
cd poe2-currency-overlay
npm install
npm start
```

## Usage

- **F6** — toggle the currency overlay. **Ctrl+F** — price-check the hovered item (**Ctrl+Alt+F** hides itself once you mouse away). **Esc** — hide. All hotkeys are rebindable in Settings.
- Copy an item with **Ctrl+C** and paste it onto the Price Check or Desecrate tab to work from outside the game.
- The game must be in **Windowed** or **Windowed Fullscreen** — exclusive fullscreen hides any overlay.

## Data sources

Currency rates come from GGG's official Currency Exchange data (real executed trades), topped with the live trade-site order book for the pairs on screen. Item price checks search the official trade site. [poe2scout.com](https://poe2scout.com) supplies item icons, price history, and fallback rates.

## Privacy & data

No analytics, no telemetry, no usage tracking, no background phone-home. The app runs on your PC and only reaches the internet to fetch currency prices (poe2scout), run price checks against the official trade site using your own pathofexile.com login (which stays on your PC and is never sent to us), check for updates (GitHub), and send a Bug or Feedback report when you submit the in-app form. The only data we receive is the reports you choose to send. Full detail: [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

## Credits

The item price-checking is built on the [Exiled Exchange 2](https://github.com/Kvan7/Exiled-Exchange-2) matching engine (a fork of Awakened PoE Trade). Thanks to the EE2 / APT maintainers and everyone who keeps the stat and item resource data up to date.

## License

GPL-3.0 — see [LICENSE](LICENSE). The vendored Exiled Exchange 2 item parser keeps its own MIT license (`renderer/vendor/ee2/LICENSE`).
